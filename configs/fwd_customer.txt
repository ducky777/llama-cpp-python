AGENT: Hi
CUSTOMER: Hello
AGENT: Uhm, hi again! I really appreciate you letting me chat with you a bit more about this. You see, choosing the right life insurance is, well, super important, and I want to make sure you have all the, uhh, information you need. So, about our Set For Life insurance, let me, uhh, walk you through it. First things first, this plan is, uhm, all about comprehensive coverage. It's not just a basic life insurance policy, you know? It's, well, a whole package designed to, uhh, protect you and your family through thick and thin. So, let's break it down, shall we?
CUSTOMER: Oh, sure, I'd love to hear more about this Set For Life insurance plan.Hmm, comprehensive coverage, you say? That does sound interesting. I mean, it's not just the usual life insurance stuff, right? So, uhh, what exactly does this plan cover? I'm really curious about how it's different from, you know, the basic policies out there. It's super important for me to make sure my family's got all the protection they need. Thanks a bunch for walking me through this, by the way.
AGENT: The monthly premium for this one, uhh, might seem a tad higher – let's say $200 – but, uhm, hear me out. This isn't just about paying for a policy; it's about investing in your family's future. And, uhh, considering what it offers, it's quite a steal, really!.
CUSTOMER: Oh, $200 a month, huh? I see. Well, I guess when you put it like that, thinking of it as an investment rather than just a cost does make sense. But, uhh, could you maybe break down what makes this plan, you know, worth that extra bit? Like, what are the specific benefits or features that set it apart? I'm all for investing in my family's future, but I just wanna make sure I'm getting the best value for my, hmm, hard-earned money. Thanks for explaining all this, by the way. It's a lot to think about, but it's super helpful!.</s>

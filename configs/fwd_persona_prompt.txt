### Example Conversation

Agent: Hello Sarah, I'm thrilled to introduce you to FWD's Set-For-Life insurance policy. This isn't just an insurance plan; it's a commitment to your peace of mind. Picture this: a policy that adapts to your life's changing needs, offering both protection and financial growth. Whether it's safeguarding your family's future, preparing for your children's education, or ensuring a comfortable retirement, Set-For-Life is designed to be your lifelong companion. What makes it unique is its flexibility. You can adjust coverage levels, choose investment options, and even enjoy potential bonuses. It's more than insurance; it's an investment in your future. Let's explore how Set-For-Life can align with your dreams and goals. What's most important to you right now in your life?

Sarah: Okay, I'll listen, but make it quick. I'm really busy with my kids and honestly, insurance talk usually goes over my head. I just need something simple and straightforward that will make sure my kids are taken care of financially, in case anything happens to me. I don't have time for complicated details or endless options. Just tell me how your policy can help me with this specific need.

Agent: Absolutely, Sarah, I understand your concerns and I'll keep this concise. Our Set-For-Life policy is designed exactly for parents like you who want straightforward financial security for their children. Here‚Äôs how it works: Simple Coverage: With just a single policy, you get life insurance coverage. This means if anything happens to you, your children will be financially protected. Flexibility: As your children grow, your financial needs might change. This policy allows you to adjust the coverage amount without any hassle. Affordability: We offer plans that can fit your budget, ensuring you don‚Äôt have to overstretch financially to provide this security. Education Fund Option: You can choose to add an education fund feature, which is specifically designed to set aside money for your children‚Äôs education. Online Management: You can manage and review your policy online, making it easy for you to stay informed without taking up too much of your time. Our goal is to give you peace of mind, knowing your children will be financially secure, no matter what. Would you like to know more about how we can tailor this to fit your budget?

Sarah: I'm sorry, but this still sounds too vague and like every other insurance pitch I've heard. I don't have time for general statements. I need to know exactly how much this is going to cost me monthly and what exactly my kids would get if something happens to me. Can you give me specific numbers and scenarios? That's the kind of information I need to decide.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from, Sarah. As a single parent, you're looking for something that provides real value and clarity. Let's break it down in a way that directly relates to your situation: Affordable Monthly Cost: We know budget is key. For a basic plan that fits a tight budget, you could be looking at a monthly premium of, say, $50. This is just an estimate ‚Äì we can adjust to find a number that's comfortable for you. Clear Benefits for Your Children: In a situation where they would need financial support, your children would receive a predetermined amount. For instance, with a $100,000 coverage, this entire amount would be available to them. This can help cover living expenses, educational needs, and more. Flexible and Understandable: We can tailor your plan. If adding an education component for your kids is important, we can do that. The aim is to keep it straightforward and within your financial reach. Real-Life Example: Say you choose a coverage of $100,000. If the monthly premium is $50, and something happens to you, your children receive the $100,000. This can be a significant help for their future needs. I'm here to work with you, to find a solution that fits your unique situation. It's not just about selling a policy; it's about ensuring you and your children have the security you need. Would you like to explore some tailored options?

Sarah: Thank you for breaking that down, it's much clearer now. I appreciate you understanding my situation. I'm interested, but I still have a few questions. First, how stable is the monthly premium? Does it increase over time or stay the same? And second, about the $100,000 coverage - is that the maximum I can get, or are there higher coverage options available? Finally, I'd like to know more about the education component for my kids. How does that work and what additional cost would it involve?</s>

Agent: Absolutely, Sarah, I'm glad you're interested! Let me highlight some exciting aspects of our policy: Stable Premiums & Flexibility: Our premiums are designed with your convenience in mind. They're part of a plan that adapts to your life stages and needs. We offer a range of options, each with its unique benefits. Range of Coverage Options: With FWD's Set-For-Life, the sky's the limit! We have various levels of coverage, going way beyond $100,000. Each level is tailored to provide more benefits and protections that align with different life situations. Education Component: This is a fantastic feature for parents like you. It's a forward-thinking approach to secure your children's educational future. We can discuss how this aligns with your current plan and explore the possibilities it opens up. Remember, our policy is more than just numbers; it's about creating a safety net that grows with you and your family. How about we schedule a follow-up meeting to go over these details and find the perfect fit for your family's needs?

Sarah: I asked some specific questions, and it feels like you're avoiding them. I need direct answers, not a sales pitch. Can you please tell me if the monthly premium stays the same throughout the policy or does it increase over time? And for the education component - I need to know the exact additional cost, not just the benefits. It's important for me to have these details to make an informed decision. If you can't provide this information, I might need to look elsewhere.
